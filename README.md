# Ashby-plot-Averages-
I made a generalised Ashby plot where you can add two features, Use the guideline with a performance index slope between the two feature's and compare them (I used averages alone and not Max min and average) and then use the guideline to pick out the best material for the Mechanical Design. It's a first project I would love any help on this
